            <div class="gamedescription"><b>Portal 2</b><br>Valve Software<br>April 19 2011<br><center>---------------------------------------------<br> I first played Portal 2 on my Xbox 360, I was captivated. Great story, fun game, I hated the fucking controls though. There's a reason I don't like Splatoon too much. First game I played when I got an old laptop and installed Steam.</center></div>

            <div class="gamedescription"><b>Death Stranding</b><br>Kojima Studios<br>November 8 2019<br><center>---------------------------------------------<br> My first playthrough of the game was on my playstation, the BT's were scaary, I would avoid BT zones whenever possible (duh) and lowkey held my breath with Sam while walking through them. I picked up the Director's Cut on PC and I was a menace. I cleared out so many MULE camps and threw their bodies into the tar pits, 100% it, killed any BT I saw. Never thought I would love Walking Simulator so much.</center></div>

            <div class="gamedescription"><b>Borderlands 2</b><br>Gearbox<br>September 18 2012<br><center>---------------------------------------------<br> Borderlads 2 was fuuuun. I got it when I saw a small time streamer I used to chill with play it. I put in like 80 hours on my own through the campaign, and like 60 with some friends. Picked up Borderlands 3 and got a bunch of hours on that too. Still play it every now and again, so much content you can really just play it forever. Did you see the trailed for Borderlands 4? </center></div>

            <div class="gamedescription"><b>Wii</b><br>Nintendo<br>November 19 2006<br><center>---------------------------------------------<br> The first console I owned, 3 total, all first gen backwards compatible with the Gamecube. I used to watch netflix using the disk version of the app, played a lot of Mario. Galaxy, WiiWare ports, New Super Mario Bros Wii, I still don't get why they made than last one so long. And I still don't forgive my sister for putting coins in the disk drive. </center></div>

Never knew what the Legend of Zelda was, but it came free with the console so I played it. God I fell in love, I'm still mad at myself everyday for losing it at some point. Had to pull out the Wii to plau Skyward Sword and Twilight Princess. </center></div>

It was christmas and I had been saving up for like 6 months. I again loved the thing, played a lot of Sonic Mania. I eventually got around to playing Detroit Become Human, God of War, Death Stranding, Fallout 4, The Last of Us, Bloodborne, and my favorite off of the console, Death Stranding. So excited for the second one to come out.</center></div>
